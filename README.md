# About 
## Fixedsys Core

Fixedsys Core is a love letter to the 'Fixedsys Excelsior' font, an attempt to reinvent the feel and look of a truly unique font for modern high-resolution displays. Some creative liberties were taken when necessary, so please modify this font to fit your liking! 

I am a programmer, not a designer, so if you can improve some elements, please feel free to offer PRs. Some finer font settings configuration by someone who knows what they are doing would also be lovely. 

English alphas, numerics and special symbols typically used in programming were redrawn. Everything else is imported from Fixedsys Excelsior as a fallback.

Do whatever the original license allows you to do, I don't own the original Fixedsys, nor Fixedsys Excelsior, so this is a
modification for the original font, not a new font. Credit still would be appreciated!
