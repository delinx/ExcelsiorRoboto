I love Fixedsys Excelsior, I used it for years, yet it does not scale nicely (obviously), I since then moved to RobotoMono but I still miss the look and feel from Fixedsys Excelsior.
This project is my attempt to re-create quirks of Fixedsys Excelsior and make it scale well. I have never designed fonts before, wish me luck.
